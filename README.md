[00:30.47] Say you don't know me or recognize my face
[00:37.25] Say you don't care who goes to that kind of place
[00:43.82] Knee deep in the hoopla, sinking in your fight
[00:50.40] Too many runaways eating up the night
[01:08.90] 
[00:56.85] Marconi plays the mamba, listen to the radio, don't you remember?

[01:35.66] Someone's always playing corporation games
[01:42.18] Who cares, they're always changing corporation names
[01:48.89] We just want to dance here, someone stole the stage
[01:55.67] They call us irresponsible, write us off the page

[02:38.68] It's just another Sunday in a tired old street
[02:45.20] Police have got the choke hold, oh, then we just lost the beat
[03:16.20] 
[02:55.75] Who counts the money underneath the bar?
[03:02.35] Who rides the wrecking ball into our guitars?
[03:08.85] Don't tell us you need us 'cause we're the ship of fools
[03:15.75] Looking for America, coming through your schools
[03:39.75] 
[03:22.68] (I'm looking out over that Golden Gate bridge)
[03:23.82] (On another gorgeous sunny Saturday)
[03:25.32] (And I'm seein' that bumper to bumper traffic)
[03:48.32] 
[03:26.93] Don't you remember? (Remember)
[03:41.93] 
[03:32.28] (Here's your favorite radio station)
[03:33.23] (In your favorite radio city, the city by the bay)
